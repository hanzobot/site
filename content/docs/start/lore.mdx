# The Origin of Hanzo Bot

Hanzo Bot started as a simple idea: what if you could have a full AI team that runs on your own machine?

Built by Hanzo AI (Techstars '17), Bot combines the power of frontier AI models with a multi-channel gateway that connects to every messaging platform you use. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage — one bot, every channel.

Today, Hanzo Bot is used by thousands of developers and teams to automate workflows, manage operations, and deploy AI agents that work 24/7.
