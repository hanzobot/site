# Migrating from OpenClaw

Hanzo Bot and OpenClaw share many concepts — messaging-first agents, tool use, LLM flexibility. This guide maps OpenClaw concepts to their Hanzo Bot equivalents so you can migrate smoothly.

## Concept mapping

| OpenClaw | Hanzo Bot | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `~/.openclaw/config.json` | `bot.json` (or `bot.yaml`) | Same role — agent config, model selection, tool settings |
| Personas | Agents (`agents.list[]`) | Named agents with independent models, tools, and system prompts |
| Local-first runtime | Gateway + tiered runtimes | Cloud gateway coordinates; local/terminal/EC2 are tiers |
| Telegram/Signal/Discord | All of those + Slack, WhatsApp, iMessage, Teams | [Channels](/channels) |
| `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` + `SOUL.md` | Same file works; `SOUL.md` adds personality layer |
| Tools (filesystem, web) | Tools + Skills + MCP | Core tools built in; [skills](/tools/skills) add community packages |
| `openclaw serve` | `bot gateway` | Starts the main agent loop |
| `openclaw run` | `bot run` | One-shot agent turn |

## Install Hanzo Bot

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://hanzo.bot/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm hanzo.bot/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Migrate your config

### 1. Models

OpenClaw uses provider/model strings like `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`. Hanzo Bot uses the same format:

```json5
// bot.json
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"
    }
  }
}
```

The difference: Hanzo Bot routes through a **unified LLM gateway** that supports 100+ providers. You can mix models per agent, per cron job, or per tool call.

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      { id: "main", model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5" },
      { id: "scout", model: "openai/gpt-5.2" },
      { id: "fast", model: "minimax/MiniMax-M2.1" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. System prompts

If you have an `AGENTS.md`, it works as-is. Hanzo Bot also reads:
- `SOUL.md` — personality, tone, guardrails
- `HEARTBEAT.md` — periodic check instructions (replaces OpenClaw's polling patterns)

### 3. Channels

OpenClaw channel config maps to Hanzo Bot's channel sections:

```json5
// bot.json
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "...",
      guilds: { /* per-guild config */ }
    },
    telegram: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "..."
    },
    slack: {
      enabled: true,
      appToken: "...",
      botToken: "..."
    }
  }
}
```

See [Channels](/channels) for full setup for each platform.

### 4. Tools

OpenClaw's built-in tools (filesystem, web, shell) map to Hanzo Bot's core tools:

| OpenClaw tool | Hanzo Bot tool | Group |
|---------------|---------------|-------|
| File read/write | `read`, `write`, `edit` | `group:fs` |
| Shell exec | `exec`, `process` | `group:runtime` |
| Web browse | `browser` | `group:ui` |
| Web search | `web_search` | `group:web` |
| Web fetch | `web_fetch` | `group:web` |

You can also restrict tools per agent using [tool profiles](/tools#tool-profiles-base-allowlist).

### 5. Scheduling

OpenClaw uses basic interval scheduling. Hanzo Bot gives you two mechanisms:

- **Heartbeat**: periodic agent turn in the main session (batches multiple checks)
- **Cron**: precise 5-field scheduling with isolated sessions, model overrides, delivery targets

See [Cron vs Heartbeat](/automation/cron-vs-heartbeat) for when to use each.

## What you gain

### Multi-org / team support
Hanzo Bot supports organization, team, and project scoping. Multiple people can interact with the same agent, and sessions are isolated per context.

### Cloud-native deployment
Run on K8s with `bot gateway` in a container. The gateway handles sessions, cron, heartbeat, channels, and tool execution.

### Native crypto
Agent wallets, x402 payments, USDC on Base, 100+ chain support. See [Crypto skills](/crypto).

### Browser automation
Built-in Playwright-powered browser with snapshot, act, screenshot. No plugins needed.

### Canvas & nodes
Drive macOS companion app screens, capture camera/screen, run commands on paired devices.

### Pipeline workflows
Deterministic multi-step tool pipelines with approval gates and resume tokens. See [Pipeline](/tools/pipeline).

### Self-improvement
Telemetry loops, friction detection, continuous learning extensions. The bot gets better over time.

## Common gotchas

1. **Config format**: Hanzo Bot supports both `bot.json` and `bot.yaml`. YAML is recommended for readability.
2. **Gateway is required**: Unlike OpenClaw's local-only mode, Hanzo Bot's full feature set requires the gateway process (`bot gateway`). For quick one-shots, `bot run` works standalone.
3. **Tool allowlists**: By default, all core tools are available. Use `tools.profile` to restrict (e.g., `messaging` profile for a chat-only agent).
4. **No `openclaw plugins`**: Hanzo Bot uses [skills](/tools/skills) (community tool packages) and [plugins](/plugins) (extensions). Most OpenClaw plugin functionality has a Hanzo Bot equivalent.
