description: "Platform support overview (Gateway + companion apps)"
---

Bot core is written in TypeScript. **Node is the recommended runtime**.
Bun is not recommended for the Gateway (WhatsApp/Telegram bugs).

Companion apps exist for macOS (menu bar app) and mobile nodes (iOS/Android). Windows and
Linux companion apps are planned, but the Gateway is fully supported today.
Native companion apps for Windows are also planned; the Gateway is recommended via WSL2.

## Common links

- Install guide: [Getting Started](/start/getting-started)
- Gateway runbook: [Gateway](/gateway)
- Gateway configuration: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)
- Service status: `bot gateway status`

## Gateway service install (CLI)

Use one of these (all supported):

- Wizard (recommended): `bot onboard --install-daemon`
- Direct: `bot gateway install`
- Configure flow: `bot configure` → select **Gateway service**
- Repair/migrate: `bot doctor` (offers to install or fix the service)

The service target depends on OS:
- macOS: LaunchAgent (`com.bot.gateway` or `com.bot.<profile>`)
- Linux/WSL2: systemd user service (`bot-gateway[-<profile>].service`)
